# Computer Architecture and Logic


how do computers work
	what makes a computer a computer
		computers are everywhere	

WHAT MAKES A COMPUTER A COMPUTER-

INPUT - 
types of input (finger touch, mouse, keyboard, mic, camera, wrist/heart beat, car)

STORAGE &
PROCESSING 
all the inputs give the computer information which is then stored in memory a computers processor takes information from memory it manipulates it or changes it using an algorithm (just a series of commands) then sends the processed information back to be stored in memory again, this continues until the processed information is ready to be output 


OUTPUT
how a computer outputs information depends on what the computer is designed to do a computer display can show text, photos, videos, games, VR, the output may even send signals to control a robot and when computers connect over the internet the output from one computer could be the input for another and vise versa


binary & data
1’s and 0’s do help the computer work on the inside

bit - the smallest piece of information a computer can store
a single wire can have electricity on or off 
	1 - 0
	true - false 
	yes - no	
	on - off
more wires = more bits = more complex information

the binary number system
	the binary = 0 or 1
	
	4 positions
_    _.   _.  _
8s 4s 2s 1s

ex. 9 
1  0  0 1
8s 4s 2s 1s
(1x8)+(0x4)+(0x2)+(1x1)

any number can be represented with only 1’s and 0’s
or by a bunch of wires that are on and off
ex. with 8 wires you can store information up to 0 - 255
with 32 wires you an store fro 0 to over 4 billion

text, images & sound - can also all be represented with numbers

text in binary
all the letters in the alphabets could be assigned a number 
ex. 
a - 1 - 00001
b - 2 - 00010
c - 3 - 00011
d - 4 - 00100
e - 5 - 00101

any word or paragraph as a sequence of numbers

 D              O            G
4              15            7
00100  01111   00111

IMAGES in binary
photos, vid, graphics

each of these are represented by a pixel and each pixel has a color and each color can be represented with numbers

sound in binary
sound is a series of vibrations in the air
the vibrations can be represented on a graph
sound can be broken down into a series of numbers
better sound quality would be 32 bit over 8 bit = higher range of numbers

1 0 are the backbone of how computers store information



circuits and logic

every input and output is a type of information
on and off electric

to make input into output a computer needs to modify and combine input signals
uses millions tiny elec conpotnests

that form circuits

a simple circuit takes an electric signal and flips it
1 > 0

0> 1
“not”

complicated circuits take multiple signals & combine them to give different results
2 elect sig > 0 unless both input are 1
“and”
adder - this circuit takes in two bits 1 or 0 and adds them to calculate the sum
ex
0+0=00
0+1=01
1+1=10

put circuits side by side to add together much larger numbers

back in the day they were big and clunky but now they are microscopic
small=fast less they have the go then the faster it moves

everything you can do with technology requires lots of info motion to be processed extremely quickly*
under it all is just a bunch of tiny little circuits

CPU, memory, input and output

input devices converts physical input to binary information

memory to store the info
all the calculation are done in cpu - central processing unit calculate information

output - converts information to physical output

sensors our input devices along with much more

output devices can be screen or machines

need multiple cpu’s to process info
lots of gb of memory to store it

Hardware and software

when you look inside you see a bunch of stuff ( hardware)
 programs apps (software)

CPU - central processing unit
master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer
uses math & logic
sends & receives
*magic is knowing which circuits to use and when to use them*

binary code is the most basic code of software 
ex python, ruby, blocklly

software tells the cpu what to do

how can they all run at once
 - Operating System - the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer
  	the operating system is what is switching around so the cpu can run it all
