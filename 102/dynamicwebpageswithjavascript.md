# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

## Today's Code Along Thoughts
**I LOVED IT!** I really am one for direction so it was really fun but at the same time it was frustrating adding in code and not knowing what and why and how it does what it does until after we were done.
**at the same time though** I loved seeing my page come to life with cool features in front of my eyes!

javascript-  is an asynchronous, dynamically-typed, interpreted scripting language, designed to make web pages dynamic and interactive.

conditionals-Conditional statements control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run. There are multiple different types of conditionals in JavaScript including: “If” statements: where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code.

operators-performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. For example 1 + 2, where + sign is an operator and 1 is left operand and 2 is right operand.

data types-Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program. ... String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types. Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. Whereas Undefined and Null are special data types.

variable-A variable is a way to programmatically reference a previously assigned value.
