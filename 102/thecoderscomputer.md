# The Coder's Computer
## Choosing a Text Editor
### Why is this important?

## **A Text Editor**
- The most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
- Allows you to write and manage a text, a text that you write to built a website.
- Choose the one that fits you.

### Most Important features are
1. Code Completion
1. Syntax Highlighting
1. A nice Variety of Themes
1. The Ability to Choose from a Healthy Collections of Extentions(more options to play with).

I'm using Visual Studio Code for [CodeFellows](https://www.codefellows.org/) due to all of the accessibilities. 
This is very different then a basic text editor like textedit that you can use to copy code from and use for other purposes then coding, what is nice about a program like Visual Studio Code is that it has Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS already built in. IE - ***the job is made much easier.***

## Text Editors and IDEs
>A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title—it edits text.
It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text
wrangler” because in a way that’s what really a text editor does. It
wrangles your text together into something meaningful.
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.

### Cheet Sheet that I hope will grow
ls = list
cd = change directory 
cp = copy
pwd = print working directory
