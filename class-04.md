## **HTML & CSS** 

Chapter 4 - Links
<br>
**Main Points**
- Links are created using the ` <a>` element.
- The ` <a> ` element uses the ` href ` attribue to indicate the page ou are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relatie links rather than qualified URLs.
- You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field ` "mailto:jill@example.org" `
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.


Chapter 15 - Layout
<br>
**Main Points**
- ` <div> ` elements are often used as containint elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or lquid (strechy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pizels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help creat professional and flexible designs. 
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for ccommon tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

## **JavaScript & jQuery**

Chapter 3 - Functions, Methods, and Objects (pp.86-99 ONLY)
<br>
**Main Points**
- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task
- Functions can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value.

Declariing a Function
```
function sayHello() {
  document.write('Hello!');
}
```
Calling a Function
```
sayHello();

```

Declaring Functions that need Information
```
function get Area(width, height) {
  return width * height;
}

```

Calling Funtions that need Information
```
Arguments as values

getArea(3, 5);

Arguments as variables

wallWidth = 3;
wallHeight = 5;
getArea(wallWidth, wallHeight);


```

## **6 Reasons for Pair Programming**
1. Greater efficiency
1. Engaged collaboration
1. Learning from fellow students
1. Social skills
1. Job interview readiness
1. Work environment readiness

Before reading this article this term "pair programming" would have given me a lot of anxiety but this article really showed how great and beneficial it is to work like this. Personally I can already tell how helpful this due to the amouth of cooperation throughout the students, TA's and Teacher in my current coding 201 course.  I feel I'm not another asset for someone else and that fear along with if someone ate a plate of garlic before working closely are my hesistations. Really though I love this way of working now because it is also helping me from feeling so shy and nervous to speak up.
