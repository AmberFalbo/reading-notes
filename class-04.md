- The ` <a> ` element uses the ` href ` attribue to indicate the page ou are linking to.

Before reading this article this term "pair programming" would have given me a lot of anxiety but this article really showed how great and beneficial it is to work like this. Personally I can already tell how helpful this due to the amouth of cooperation throughout the students, TA's and Teacher in my current coding 201 course.  I feel I'm not another asset for someone else and that fear along with if someone ate a plate of garlic before working closely are my hesistations. Really though I love this way of working now because it is also helping me from feeling so shy and nervous to speak up.
