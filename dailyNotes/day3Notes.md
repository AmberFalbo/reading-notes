Code Review!

to clone repo
 git clone url

- make sure eslint is populated, it is in the class repo
—eslint is like a fancy spellchecker for JavaScript

in HTML
remember to have your reset first before style CSS

the body is EVERYTHING you see on the page!

Make your h1 what your page is about, you can only have 1 h1!

You can have multiple h2’s on a page, start a new section
 
a <p> is the start of a paragraph

Adding spaces in code makes it better for readability

add stuff to the footer like email

under footer at the js script link

In JS

always use ‘use strict’;

\ = use this so you can add add an apostrophy  ej (‘what\’s your name, beautiful?’)

cancatination is stringing together with usernames

.toLowerCase = normalizing the data

if has not space if(

else does else (

if you don’t have an option to say no then any answer could be no…

live-server at the index root will run it

hover effect!!!! on links

in CSS

body - most things

font - you can add the font family and size, ig 95% georgia sans-serif; the sans-serif is there incase browser doesn’t have georgia

line-height: 2; effects spacing between each line

organize CSS
	alphabetize it all and bring into tab, in a row under each selector

a - anchor for link
a:visited - different color when visited
a:link
a:hover - interacting with the a tag and what happens when your curser is over the item

before learning for and while statements to end or start a game
you could wrap the whole game into a if statement { }

- - it’s put in the repo - -

Box Model today!!

DEv tools to sign up for

div - block level element

inline - just goes around each other not all the way to the end

give padding - padding: 
padding: top

be consitant in size differences like px and px not em and px

padding: 10px 5px 5px 2x; top- right-bottom - left (shorthand shortcut)

to put space between the boxes
margin: 20px
margin-top: 10px

to not have margin on the very top then set up class
<div class="margin">box 2</div>
<div class="margin">box 3</div>

.margin{
  margin-top: 10px
}


to get boxes next to each other

display: inline; - ignores top and bottom padding and margin
display: inline-block; - pays attention to padding and margin

float: left;
float: right;


.container{
	display: flex;
}

span

div{
  border: 1px solid blue;
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 5px;
  width: 40px;
/*   float: left; */
  display: inline-block;

arrays= prep for sam and cookies

arrays- are used to store data, names, events, in almost everything we use
- learning about loops, they take an array and do somthing with each item in an array

working with arrays and loops together is very powerful
 - guess something until they get it right (loop, over and over until a certain word)
getting into deep logic

while loops


for loops


length of 3

i++ (add 1 to i each time)
