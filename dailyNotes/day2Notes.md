CODE REVIEW

add to slack

* = universal selector of all documents

only have one h1 tag, has the important information of the webpage

font-family = telling browser what font family to use

— sizes to use %, em, px

inline styling - in the tag
internal stylying= on same page but in head

camelCase = userName

concatination = (‘dfdd’ + name) - the plus sign helps connect string + variabe

it is convention in JS to use ‘ ‘
in HTML “ “

.toLowerCase(); = will make this lowercase =  can also be .toUpperCase();


summary consol log ig
console.log(’userName ‘ +  ‘  is from ‘ + hometown + ‘ and hate ‘ + peeve + ‘ and likes  ‘ + favorite 


__ add comments in the script ( comand / on a mac) for java
 \ignore\ - go back to video for this!!!

<! - - for html

// fouth question ig
// final response 

= leave comments to help others look at your code and comments

Zombie code = code that has been written due to being there but commented out and just left in code

COMMENTS ARE HELPFUL BUT NOT ZOMBIE CODE
