## HTML & CSS 

Chapter 3 - Lists
<br>
**Main Points**
- There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordeded, and definition.
- Ordered lists use numbers.
  - lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
   - ` <ol> ` than ` <li> `
- Unordered lists use bullets.
  - lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order)
  - ` <ul> ` than ` <li> `
- Definition lists are used to define terminology.
  - made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
  - ` <dl> ` than ` <dt> ` then for indent ` <dd> `
- Lists can be nested inside one another.
  ```
  <ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
      </ul>  
    </li>
  <li></li>
</ul>


Chapter 13 - Boxes
<br>
**Main Points**
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
- You can use CSS to control the borders, margins and padding for each box with CSS.
- You can also control the borders, margins and padding for each box with CSS.
- It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes contain text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.




## JavaScript & jQuery

Chapter 4 - Decisions & Loops
<br>
**Main Points**
- **Another reminder!**
- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
- Comparison operators (===, !==, ==, !=, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
- if...else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
- switch statements allow you to compare a value again possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
- Data types can be coerced from one type of another.
-All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
- Ther are three types of loop: for, while and do...while. Each repeats a set of statements.
