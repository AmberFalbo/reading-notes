# Classes, Inheritance, Functional Programming
## Reading, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
    - TDD reduces the time required for project development.
    - Code flexibility and easier maintenance. 
    - Save project costs in the long run.  

1. In what case would you need to use ```beforeEach()``` or ```afterEach()``` in a test suite?
    - If you have some work you need to do repeatedly for many tests.
    - They can handle asynchronous code in the same ways that tests can handle asynchronous code - they can either take a done parameter or return a promise.
    

1. What is one downside of Test Driven Development
    - It necessitates a lot of time and effort up front, which can make development feel slow.
  

1. What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
    - A child of an ES6 class is another type definition which extends the parent with new properties and methods, which in turn can be instantiated at runtime. 
    - A child of a prototype is another object instance which delegates to the parent any properties that aren't implemented on the child.
    - 

1. Name a use case for a static method
    - Use static when you want to provide class level access to a method.
    - Static methods don't need to be invoked on the object and that is when you use it. 
    - A static method belongs to the class rather than the object of a class.
    - A static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.

1. Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves
    - A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function . Higher order function is in contrast to first order functions, which don't take a function as an argument or return a function as output.
    - Higher-order functions allows you to write simpler and more elegant code.

    ```
    [1, 2, 3, 4].map(function(val){
    return val * 2
    }) // [ 2, 4, 6, 8 ]

    ```
    
  

## Vocab Terms

**functional programming** - the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. 

**pure function** - Given the same inputs, always returns the same output, and has no side-effects. 

**higher-order function** - ny function which takes a function as an argument, returns a function, or both. 

**immutable state** - Immutability is a central concept of functional programming because without it, the data flow in your program is lossy. State history is abandoned, and strange bugs can creep into your software. 

**object** - a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.

**object-orientedd programming(OOP)** - a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

**class** - a type of function, but instead of using the keyword ```function``` to initiate it, we use the keyword ```class```, and the properties are assigned inside a ```constructor()``` method.

**prototype** - s an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript, where function's prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object's prototype property.

```super``` - keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent. The super.

**inheritance** - he mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), retaining similar implementation.

**constructor** - a function that creates an instance of a class which is typically called an “object”. In JavaScript, a constructor gets called when you declare an object using the new keyword. The purpose of a constructor is to create an object and set values if there are any object properties present.

**instance** - means a reference to an “object” created by “new” or the equivalent. What's special about JavaScript, and other scripting languages, is that an “instance” is just a regular object; it's not what it is, but how it's made that is different.

**context** - refers to the object within the function being executed, this refers to the object that the function is executing in.

```this``` - refers to an object, that object which is executing the current bit of javascript code. In other words, every javascript function while executing has a reference to its current execution context, called this. Execution context means here is how the function is called.

**Test Driven Development (TDD)** - a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests) and design (in the form of refactoring).

**Jest** - an open JavaScript testing library from Facebook. Its slogan is "Delightful JavaScript Testing". While Jest can be used to test any JavaScript library, it shines when it comes to React and React Native.

**Continuous Integration** - a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

**unit test** - a level of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. It usually has one or a few inputs and usually a single output.
