# Readings: Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD
### Reading, Research, and Discussion


1. Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
    - Running JavaScript without/outside a browser means you are using node. js technology to execute your JavaScript code.
    - This type of usage of javascript typically refers to backend programming where your javascript code will interact with your database and can be used to create RESTful APIs.

1. What is the difference between a module and a package?
    - package is a file or directory that is described by a package.json file.
    - module is any file or directory in the node_modules directory that can be loaded by the Node.js require() function.

1. What does the node package manager do?
    - The name npm (Node Package Manager) stems from when npm first was created as a package manager for Node.js.

    - All npm packages are defined in files called package.json.

    - The content of package.json must be written in JSON.


1. Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module

```
module.exports = 'hello world';
```
```
exports.SimpleMessage = 'hello world';
```
```
module.exports = function (msg) {
  console.log(msg);
};

var msg = require('./Log.js');

msg('Hello World');

```

## Vocab
### Term

**ecosystem** - The JavaScript ecosystem is a collection of software packages, libraries, and other resources that facilitate development as they integrate with each other.

**Node.js** - Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.

**V8 Engine** - V8 is the Javascript engine inside of node. js that parses and runs your Javascript. The same V8 engine is used inside of Chrome to run javascript in the Chrome browser. Google open-sourced the V8 engine and the builders of node. js used it to run Javascript in node. 

**module** - Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries. A set of functions you want to include in your application.

**package** - A package is a file or directory that is described by a package. json file. A package must contain a package. json file in order to be published to the npm registry.

**node package manager (npm)** - It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently. It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases. Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs.

**server** - a computer or computer program which manages access to a centralized resource or service in a network.

**environment** - provides own objects and functions additional to the language core.

**interpreter** - JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. A program such as C++ or Java needs to be compiled before it is run. ... In contrast, JavaScript has no compilation step. Instead, an interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it.

**compiler** - The source code is passed through a program called a compiler, which translates it into bytecode that the machine understands and can execute.
