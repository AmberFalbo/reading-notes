# Readings: Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD
### Reading, Research, and Discussion


1. Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
    - Running JavaScript without/outside a browser means you are using node. js technology to execute your JavaScript code.
    - This type of usage of javascript typically refers to backend programming where your javascript code will interact with your database and can be used to create RESTful APIs.

1. What is the difference between a module and a package?
    - package is a file or directory that is described by a package.json file.
    - module is any file or directory in the node_modules directory that can be loaded by the Node.js require() function.

1. What does the node package manager do?
    - The name npm (Node Package Manager) stems from when npm first was created as a package manager for Node.js.

    - All npm packages are defined in files called package.json.

    - The content of package.json must be written in JSON.


1. Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module

```
module.exports = 'hello world';
```
```
exports.SimpleMessage = 'hello world';
```
```
module.exports = function (msg) {
  console.log(msg);
};

var msg = require('./Log.js');

msg('Hello World');

```
