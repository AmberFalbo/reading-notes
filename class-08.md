## **HTML & CSS** 

Chapter 15 - Layout
<br>
**Main Points**
- ` <div> ` elements are often used as containint elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or lquid (strechy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pizels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help creat professional and flexible designs. 
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for ccommon tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
