“People are unhappy in large part because they are confused about what is valuable.” -William Irvine

This is something I struggle with a lot. I am consstantly stressed and feeling behind as I say "yes" to everything and geniuenly undervalue myself, time and worth. This read was really a "slap in the face" for me and hit me in places I feel the most. It's very hard being a people pleaser but also valuing your time, I have often become burnt out trying to please others vs taking the better more focused path thats best suited for me. 

"If you don’t treat yourself and your time with respect, you will become unhappy, resentful, and tired. Your body and mind long for mastery and freedom; you can’t have those things if your time is cheap and easily taken."

I relate to this in more ways then one. My health often suffers from an abundance of stress so this is something I really strive to take more serious. 

### We all deserve to value our time and learn to say no to more things!

## [How to think like a programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)

“Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs

### Steps for success when encountering a new problem.

1. Understand
    - Know exactly what is being asked. You know when you understand the problem when you can explain in plain terms.

2. Plan
    - Plan your solution! Comments help keep you on plan a lot! To get a goo plan, answer this question:
    "Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?"

3. Divide
    - Don't try to solve one big problem at once. You will cry!(I know, that's usually my problem!) Break the problem up into little bits.

4. Stuck!
     - don't worry it happens to everyone! 
        - Debug
        - Reassess
        - Research
