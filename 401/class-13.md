# 401 Notes-13: Linear Regressions

## **Regression**

- The dependent features are called the dependent variables, outputs, or responses.
- The independent features are called the independent variables, inputs, or predictors.
- Regression problems usually have one continuous and unbounded dependent variable.
  - The inputs, however, can be continuous, discrete, or even categorical data such as gender, nationality, brand, and so on.
- It is a common practice to denote the outputs with 𝑦 and inputs with 𝑥.
  - If there are two or more independent variables, they can be represented as the vector 𝐱 = (𝑥₁, …, 𝑥ᵣ), where 𝑟 is the number of inputs.
- You need to find a function that maps some features or variables to others sufficiently well.

## When do you need Regression?
> - **To answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related.**
  - Regression is also useful when you want to forecast a response using a new set of predictors.

# **Linear Regression**
> Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression techniques. It’s among the simplest regression methods. One of its main advantages is the ease of interpreting results.
