## [JupyterLab docs](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)

JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter. 

Within Jupyter you use Markdown to make annotations like we have before, in this space is where we can have a whole environment open to create a project. 

### NumPy

Working with Numpy we use a lot of concepts we already know to build a sort of grid of sorts. (trying to take notes on what I'm getting from the reading vs just fact blocks)  You can make grids (2, 4) and you would use numpy to set up your project. From there you can look at the shape, pick exact points. 

>**I'm super stuck on BROADCASTING** I have been mostly trying to figure that out. Seems like a puzzle. Then add on what I feel I know from today. Though it was nice having a Markdown review for JupyterLab!
