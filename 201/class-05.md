Chapter 5 - Images
<br>
**Main Points**
- The `< img >` element is used to add images to a web page.
- You must alsways specify an ` src ` atrribute to indicate the source of an image and an ` alt ` attribute to describe the content of an image.
- You should save image at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropiate format.
- Photographs are best saved as `JPEGs`; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as `GIFs`.

Chapter 11 - Color
<br>
**Main Points**
- Color not only bring your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: `RGB values, hex codes, and color names`. 
- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast betweeen any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
- CSS3 has introdued an extra value for `RGB` colors to indicate opacity. It is known as `RGBA`.
- CSS3 also allows ou to specify colors as `HSL` values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

Chapter 12 - Text
<br>
**Main Points**
- There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.
- There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed
- If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.
- You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
- You an use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visted a link.
