Going on Canvas as a class

Tips for Success
	•	Get ready to tackle some seriously ambitious material! You'll have the most success if you:
	•	Take notes during class.
	•	Keep up with the daily assignments (code and reading).
	•	Research topics that are new or confusing.
	•	Speak up when you're stuck for more than 15 minutes.
	•	Be thorough and deliberate when reading error messages and console/terminal responses. Take your time and do not go too fast. Always know what you are doing.
	•	And, above all else, pay attention to details.
 
>from canvas!

Remember!! labs are meant for you to get stuck, ask for help after 15 minutes of being suck!
	* ask a classmate for help first
	* then TA
	* Lena (teacher)

</head>

<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Hello 201!</h1>
  </header>

  <main></main>


  <footer></footer>
</body>



</html>
```

inline styles (only used today)
inline styles <h1 style=“color: purple”> blah blah </h1>

we don’t do this so everything can keep its on job, inline style mixes it all together but isn’t the best to do things

white space in html helps readability, indents need to be delt with carefully and organized

Padding: separates from surrounding boxes

JavaScript is loaded top to bottom!!! 
So is HTML
add script tag at bottom of html page!!!! (under footer)


alert - press ok to exit
prompt- response box
var prompt (var see it in console)

catatination -(‘ string (space) ‘ + name)

^c gets you out ove live server!
