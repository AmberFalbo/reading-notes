## HTML & CSS 
Chapter 2 - Text
<br>
**Main Points**
- HTML elements are used to describe the struture of the page (e.g. headings, subheading, paragraphs).
- They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when give text is a quotation).

Text is part the the structure and integrity of the page. HTML can change a bit of the text before CSS can style it with a few tags here and there. This includes horizontal breaks in the page, quote tags to block or just add quotations, changes to content like a delete tag which will put a line through text or a s tag to s strike it out with a thinner line and not indicating deletion.  There is a bit you can do in HTML to add your own embelishments.

Chapter 10 - Introducing CSS
<br>
**Main Points**
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside it's own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separet document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

All CSS rules have a selector and a declaration as though the selector was who you were talking to and the declaration is the what you were asking.  You can specify your selector to a single id! You can have your CSS in a sytle section in your head of your HTML or on a seperate style page and add the link to the page in the head of your HTML instead which can be easier to go back and change items.

## JavaScript & jQuery

Chapter 2 - Basic JavaScript Instructions
<br>
**Main Points**
- A script is made up of a series of staements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
-Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
- Arrays are special types of variale that store more than one piece of related informataion. 
- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
- Expressions evaluate into a single value.
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.




Chapter 4 - Decisions & Loops
<br>
**Main Points**
- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
- Comparison operators (===, !==, ==, !=, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
- if...else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
- switch statements allow you to compare a value again possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
- Data types can be coerced from one type of another.
-All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
- Ther are three types of loop: for, while and do...while. Each repeats a set of statements.
