## **HTML & CSS** 

Chapter 6 - Tables (pp.126-145)
<br>
**Main Points**
- The `<table>` element is used to add tables to a web page.
- A table is drawen out row by row. Each row is created with the `<tr>` element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the `<tr>` element (or `<tr>` if it is a header).
- You can make cells of a table pan more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- For long tables you can split the table into a `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`.


## **JavaScript & jQuery**

Chapter 3 - Functions, Methods, and Objects (pp.106-144)
<br>
**Main Points**
- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you.
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; funtions are known as methods of the object.
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browswer window and the document loadded into the browser window.
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects suchas `String`, `Number`, Math`, and `Date`. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both an contain the other).
