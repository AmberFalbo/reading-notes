## **JavaScript & jQuery**

Chapter 2 - jQuery (pp.293-301, 306-331 & 354-357)
- Skim (302-305 & 332-225)

**Main Points**

- jQuery is a JavaScript file you include in your pages.
- Once included, it makes it faster and easier to write cross-browser JavaScript, based on two steps:
1. Using CSS-style selectors to collect one or more nodes from the DOM tree.
2. Using jQuery's built-in methods to work with the elements in that selection.
- jQuery's CSS-style selector syntax makes it easier to select elements to work with, It also has methods that make it easier to traverse the DOM.
- jQuery makes it easier to handle events because the event methods work across all browsers.
- jQuery offers methods that make it quick and simple to achieve a range of tasks that JavaScript programmers commonly need to perform

From rereading this article and experiencing pair programming I have to say that I like it a lot more then I thought. I get nervous about having enough skills to be a good Navigator and as the Driver need to pause more often as to not go beyond what the Navigator is saying. Often with pair programming I've noticed a groove and it  seems like we can predict some of the next moves. I'm not sure if thats ok but it's really fun. It's really helpful to have another set of eyes on each other's code to really find the problems and ways to fix them faster.
